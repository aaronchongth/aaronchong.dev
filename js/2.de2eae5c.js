Deblurring an image is directly useful for photography but is also useful for preprocessing inputs to deep learning networks. Classical deblurring techniques as well as various deep learning techniques have been used to deblur images in the past. We have used a Generative Adversarial Network to deblur images in the self-driving domain.

However, the world is imperfect and image classification networks often have to classify noisy images. One form of noise is motion blur. Because the majority of these networks are trained and tested on carefully curated datasets which only contain clear, sharp images, the networks perform poorly on blurry images. If the blur in the images could be removed, then the networks could improve their accuracy. A classical strategy to deblur images is to select a deblurring kernel and then convolve the kernel across the image to restore it. Selecting the deblurring kernel is often a difficult and imprecise task. The optimal deblurring kernel is unique to the motion blur in the image, and selecting the wrong kernel produces inaccurate results. Kupyn et al. have recently presented DeblurGAN, which aims to solve this problem of motion blurred images through the use of a Generational Adversarial Network (GAN). In this project we will implement DeblurGAN and then adapt it to work with new datasets and validation methods.
