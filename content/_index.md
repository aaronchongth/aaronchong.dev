Hello there! My name is Aaron, and I am a software engineer at the Open Source Robotics Foundation.

I am very fond of topics in math, computer science, machine vision & learning, especially in the field of robotics. 

In my free time, I like to start new projects, learn new things, read books, or swing my tennis racquet around.
