      <title>Atlassian Deployment Triggers</title>

      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Variable Stiffness Spring Actuators for Low-Energy-Cost Human Augmentation</title>

      <description>Theoretical studies suggest and experimental evidence confirms that maintaining and changing human joint stiffness by coactivated antagonistic muscles are metabolically expensive, even if muscles do not perform net mechanical work. Based on this observation, we posit that effective human augmentation can be achieved by actuators operated in parallel to human joints, even if these actuators only supplement joint stiffness without doing net mechanical work. In this article, we present a prototype variable-length leaf-spring actuator capable of large-range stiffness modulation.</description>

      <title>Stiffness Modulator: A Novel Actuator for Human Augmentation </title>
      <link>https://aaronchong.dev/publications/stiffnessmodulator/</link>

      <description>Stiffness modulators are devices that promote a novel means of actuation; they provide stiffness modulation without deliberately doing mechanical work. These type of compliant actuators may be used for human augmentation to complement co-contracted antagonistic muscles and as such reduce muscle activity and metabolic energy cost. Despite the theoretical appeal of this concept, its implementation remains elusive in practical applications. This is particularly true for human augmentation which requires a portable stiffness modulator.</description>

      <title>Analytical conditions for the design of variable stiffness mechanisms </title>
      <link>https://aaronchong.dev/publications/analyticaldesign/</link>

      <description>This paper introduces an analytical approach for the design of variable stiffness mechanisms. The basis of this approach is a general model - representing the potential energy function and the physical constraints - covering the design space of variable stiffness mechanisms. Using this model, we present a systematic procedure to analytically define classes of variable stiffness mechanisms from first principles. Consequently, we identify mechanisms capable of infinite range stiffness modulation using bounded motor forces, and define the simplest mathematical model representing mechanisms in this class.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://aaronchong.dev/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&#39;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc).Â Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>While adding Structured Data to a client&#39;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid. Simple contribution to cleanup the user documentation providing syntactically valid JSON documents.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; attack.</description>

      <title>Search Results</title>
      <link>https://aaronchong.dev/search/</link>

      <guid>https://aaronchong.dev/search/</guid>
      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>

      <title>VEGAN - Visual Enhancement GAN</title>
      <link>https://aaronchong.dev/projects/creations/vegan/</link>

      <description>Visual Enhancement GAN is a generative adversarial network trained to deblur images to be used as data for high speed applications, specifically in the self driving domain. We built on the work of Kupyn et. al to improve multiscale performance, introduced training with Scaled Perceptual Loss, Smoothness Loss, as well as using a Random Scaled Cropaugmentation technique. Additionally we also introduced a Fourier Domain Error, as a way to better evaluate the performance of an image deblurring network.</description>
