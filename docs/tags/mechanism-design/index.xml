      <description>Theoretical studies suggest and experimental evidence confirms that maintaining and changing human joint stiffness by coactivated antagonistic muscles are metabolically expensive, even if muscles do not perform net mechanical work. Based on this observation, we posit that effective human augmentation can be achieved by actuators operated in parallel to human joints, even if these actuators only supplement joint stiffness without doing net mechanical work. In this article, we present a prototype variable-length leaf-spring actuator capable of large-range stiffness modulation.</description>
